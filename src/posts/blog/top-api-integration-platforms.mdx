## Real Talk: My API Integration Journey

When I started, I was drowning in API docs and custom scripts

Switching to a dedicated platform was a game-changer:
- Slashed integration time by 70%
- Freed up devs for core product work
- Improved reliability across the board

The right tool doesn't just save time
It transforms how you approach integrations

## Code Example: Quick API Integration with Collect

Let's see how Collect simplifies API integration:

```javascript
// Create a new user record
const user = await UserRepo.create({
  email: "dev.ninja@code.com",
  name: "Dev Ninja",
  role: "API Wrangler"
})

// Fetch orders with related product info
const orders = await OrderRepo.find({
  where: {
    total: { $gt: 100 },
    PRODUCT: {
      category: "Electronics",
      inStock: true
    }
  }
})

// Update merchant balance in a transaction
const tx = await Collect.tx.begin()

try {
  const order = await OrderRepo.create(
    { total: 150, productId: 123 },
    tx
  )
  
  const merchant = await MerchantRepo.findOne(
    { id: order.merchantId },
    tx
  )
  
  await merchant.update(
    { balance: merchant.data.balance + order.data.total },
    tx
  )
  
  await tx.commit()
} catch (error) {
  await tx.rollback()
  console.error("Transaction failed:", error)
}
```

With Collect, you're writing less boilerplate and focusing more on your business logic. It's not just about saving keystrokes – it's about freeing your mind to solve the real problems.
