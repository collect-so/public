## Key Features

### Dynamic APIs

One of Collect's standout features is its ability to automatically generate APIs based on the data you send. This means you can effortlessly retrieve your data as if a dedicated backend team had spent months building the APIs. This feature significantly reduces the time and effort needed to develop and maintain custom APIs.

```typescript
// Example: Saving a new user record
const user = await Collect.save("user", {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
})

// Retrieve the user record using the autogenerated API
const retrievedUser = await fetch("/api/v1/label/user").then((response) =>
  response.json(),
)

console.log(retrievedUser)
```

### Data Nesting and Linking

Collect allows you to work with data the way you think about it. You can store nested data within records and link related records easily. This capability is perfect for building complex data relationships and ensuring that all relevant data is accessible in one place.

```typescript
// Example: Creating nested data and linking records
const user = await Collect.save("user", {
  name: "Alice",
  orders: [
    {
      product: "Laptop",
      price: 1200,
    },
    {
      product: "Phone",
      price: 800,
    },
  ],
})

const order = await Collect.save("order", {
  product: "Tablet",
  price: 500,
})

// Link the order to the user
await user.link(order)

console.log("User with linked orders:", user)
```

### Importing and Exporting Data

Collect supports fast data import and export, handling up to 3000 records in less than a second. This feature ensures that your data can be quickly integrated into the platform and easily extracted when needed.

```typescript
// Example: Importing data
const importedData = await fetch("/api/v1/import", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(dataToImport),
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
})

// Example: Exporting data
const exportedData = await fetch("/api/v1/export").then((response) =>
  response.json(),
)

console.log("Exported Data:", exportedData)
```

### File Storage

Binary data is also supported, allowing you to store various file types directly within Collect. This makes it an excellent choice for projects that require robust file storage and management capabilities.

```typescript
// Example: Storing a file
const fileData = new FormData()
fileData.append("file", fileInput.files[0])

const uploadResponse = await fetch("/api/v1/file/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: fileData,
})

console.log("File upload response:", uploadResponse)
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a New Project: Begin by creating a new project in the Collect dashboard.
2. Obtain an SDK Token: Once your project is set up, obtain an SDK Token from the Project page.
3. Submit Your Data: Use this token to submit any data to Collect’s API endpoints.
4. Retrieve Your Data: Retrieve your data by making requests to the appropriate API endpoints.

```typescript
// Example: Submitting data using SDK token
const sdkToken = "YOUR_SDK_TOKEN"
const data = { name: "Sample Data" }

const response = await fetch("https://api.collect.so/api/v1/collect/json", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${sdkToken}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
})

const result = await response.json()
console.log("Data submitted:", result)
```
